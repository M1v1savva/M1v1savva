- ✏️ Education: BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence), graduated in Dec. 2022. My [thesis](https://github.com/M1v1savva/anime-thesis) was about making cartoon faces with Generative Adversarial Networks.
