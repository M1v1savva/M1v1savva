### My background [or CV for more detail](https://m1v1savva.github.io/cv)

- ✏️ Education: BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence), graduated in Dec. 2022. My [thesis](https://github.com/M1v1savva/anime-thesis) was about making cartoon faces with Generative Adversarial Networks. 
- 💻 Industry: I worked as a part-time NLP Engineer in a Garant (Russian mass provider of a legal referencing system) from August to December 2021. I had later decided to focus on my studies until I graduated. <br/>

- 📝 During high school and early university I did some competitive programming, competed in Russian olympiad in informatics and got some decent results [on codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/M1v1savva1601). Now I occasionally coach and solve problems for fun.
